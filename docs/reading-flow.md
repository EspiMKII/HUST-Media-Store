<h1 align="center" style="font-size:24px;">READING FLOW</h1>

This document gives a general flow of how this series of documentations should be read.

1. [Account Hierarchy](account-hierarchy.md)
2. [Media Types](media-type.md)
3. The UI designs:
    
    1. [Login Screen](UIs/login-screen.md)
    2. [Purchase Screen](UIs/purchase-screen.md)
    3. [Staff Info Screen](UIs/staff-info-screen.md)
    4. [Financial Details Screen](UIs/financial-details-screen.md)
    5. [Store Edit Screen](UIs/store-edit-screen.md)
    
    Note that the screens described from 2 to 5 should actually just be different tabs in 1 screen (that is, the application shouldn't open another screen when the user switches tabs)

    6. [Data Tables Required](data.md)
